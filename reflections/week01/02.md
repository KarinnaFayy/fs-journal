## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

a pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element. I believe I will commonly use are: :hover , :link , :active.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is useful if you have two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, there are some basic rules that a browser follows to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The !important feature is often considered bad practice because it can mess with specificity.
