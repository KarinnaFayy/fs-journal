## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

It's difficult to choose only one favorite tip to improve. However, I appreciate the shadow, using fewer borders, and extra spacing between elements.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I found that www.squarespace.com and www.webflow.com provided good design ideas!

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I believe good design immensely influences people while visiting the site because it can be frustrating attempting to navigate a website with poor design. It's important to try and lead the viewer through the page rather than them encountering some sort of scavenger hunt.
