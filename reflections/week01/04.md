## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

The purpose of wire-framing is to give yourself an opportunity to map out you web design plans prior to diving into the code. Also, it's an important skill to have to present design ideas to clients.


2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are low, mid and high fidelity wire-frames. Low fidelity wire-frames are useful for starting conversations, deciding on navigation layout, and mapping the user flow. Mid-fidelity wire-frames feature more accurate representations of the layout, and are the most commonly used level of wire-framing. Lastly, high-fidelity wire-frames boast pixel-specific layouts

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I 100% believe that wire-frames are worth the time and energy simply because they make the design process easier to approach. I also believe I will utilize wire-frames to discuss design ideas with future clients.
