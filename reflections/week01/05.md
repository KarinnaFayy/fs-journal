# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This week went extremely well. It's my first week back to class after taking a break to enhance my foundation of basic knowledge for coding. During my break, I took time to do some retrospection and found solutions to all the challenges I encountered while learning how to learn. I am so thankful for the entire CodeWorks staff and I am so excited to continue this journey!

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

So far, I have not encountered anything as a shock because this week has felt like a review week for me. Un-related to web design, however, I learned that sitting at the front of the classroom has made a HUGE difference in my ability to retain information provided by the instructors.

- What are you struggling with?

As of now I have not encountered any struggles. I know I will experience some in the near future and look forward to tackling those challenges!

- What would you count as a victory?

I count the entire week as a victory.!
