## Questions

1. What is Scope ?


Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code. the two types of scopes are local ad global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.



2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

var declarations are globally scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.
