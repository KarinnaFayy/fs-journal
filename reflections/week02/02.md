## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

-Function Declaration

-Function Expression

-Generator Function

The main difference between functions in Javascript and other programming languages is that in javascript functions are of first-class objects, which means that they behave like objects and can be assigned to variables, array, and other objects.


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. Parameter is variable in the declaration of function. Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results.

Taking an other function as an argument is often referred as a callback function, because it is called back by the higher-order function. This is a concept that Javascript uses a lot.

Example: 

const double = n => n * 2

[1, 2, 3, 4].map(double) // [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]

[1, 2, 3, 4].map(function(n){
    return n * 2
}) // [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let newArray = []

for(let i = 0; n < array.length; i++) {
    newArray[i] = array[i] * 2
}

newArray // [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]
