## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before starting the coding process is important because its helpful to have a wire frame to reflect on. It is very easy to get lost in the coding matrix and forget your original plans.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When I am stuck I like to exhaust all of my resources such as Google prior to asking for help from a T.A. 

I typically stick to finding answers from: 

-StackOverflow

-WebMDN

-Bootstrap5.0

and many more.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

I would say my top 3 takeaways came from these sections:

"Not Quitting"

"Not Googling"

"Planning for the Unknown"
