# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This week went extremely well! I had a difficult time understanding the functionality portion the first time I came through this week of the course. However, I feel much more confident with writing For Loops and Functions now.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was slightly surprised at how truly simple some of the logic can be when you don't try to dissect and investigate the "whys" of how everything works...Sometimes you have to just LET. IT. WORK.

- What are you struggling with?

A struggle I noticed this week would be working in a group of 3. I found that we all had trouble communicating our thought processes and also had a difficult time staying on track. We spent a lot of time on the design of our page rather than the functionality and that sort of crippled our success.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count my weekend project as a victory! I got stuck on a few things for quite some time. With rest breaks and utilizing my resources I found the solution to all of my challenges!
