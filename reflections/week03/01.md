## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

The export statement is useful when creating JavaScript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the import statement. 

2. How does export differ from export default?

With exports, I can have multiple named exports per file. Then import the specific exports I want surrounded in braces. As for export default, the name of the imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module. I can have only one default export per file. When importing I have to specify a name and import.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Using the Module System is very efficient due to the organization it provides and it also leads to easier debugging.
