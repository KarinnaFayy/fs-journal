## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get and Set are basic operations that can have some custom logic specified by the handler object.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

We need to create a custom override for get called a trap.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

A benefit is if you want to make the ID property of an object a private property you can create a Proxy of this object to override the get operator to prevent us from accessing the ID property!
