> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?


The observer pattern ensures that when one object changes state, the dependent objects are updated automatically.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

1. Provides methods to register and remove observer. 
2. Maintains a list of its observers/subscribers. 
3. notifies them automatically when any state changes.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.


The magic of the bcw-template is extremely useful to get started with using the observer pattern. By showing simple examples with "values" as to how the proxy objects are applied and how the different modules communicate with one another.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Unfortunately, I spent most of this week home sick; so I was attempting to work collaboratively with my classmates via Zoom to build a Sporting Goods Store! I believe it went well but we still need to add functionality to the app.
