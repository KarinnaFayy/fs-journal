# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Accumulating a decent understanding of how the observer pattern and proxystate works for the MVC pattern.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was shocked to discover just how much organization the MVC pattern can provide while creating an application! At a first glance it can be slightly overwhelming looking at the MVC template, however the more I get accustomed to the pattern the more i realize how convenient it truly is!



- What are you struggling with?

The biggest struggle I had this week was trying to attend class via Zoom since I was sick at home. 

- What would you count as a victory?


I would count my checkpoint as a victory!! I ran into some major challenges with the checkboxes and making sue the list rendered upon refresh but with determination, I believe I have met all of the requirements!
