## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

-Keep your code shallow
-Modularize
-Handle every single error

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`


-Keep your code shallow
(Don‚Äôt nest functions. Give them names and place them at the top level of your program)

-Modularize
(Use function hoisting to your advantage to move functions ‚Äòbelow the fold‚Äô -- ‚ÄúWrite small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can‚Äôt get into callback hell if you don‚Äôt go there.‚Äù)

-Handle every single error
(Create reusable functions and place them in a module to reduce the cognitive load required to understand your code. Splitting your code into small pieces like this also helps you handle errors, write tests, forces you to create a stable and documented public API for your code, and helps with refactoring.)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today I gained an understanding of how to call to the API for data rather than storing data in a local host and practiced retriving trivia questions from an API.
