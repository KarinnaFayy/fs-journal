## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer a client a visual representation of the state of the requested resource. 

2. What does Stateless mean?


Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesnâ€™t remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesnâ€™t remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
