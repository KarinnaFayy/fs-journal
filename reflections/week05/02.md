## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

- One to one
- One to many
- Many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

One benefit is that the document is less likely to exceed the max file size and the second is that pagination is easier with linking.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Many-to-many relationships seem very complex. Determining if you can identify references that have fewer relationships, consider the adding and removing of relationships.
