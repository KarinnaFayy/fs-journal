# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

 We thought about how this project would look in a developer portfolio and tried to make sure it looked nice on the visual part of it.

2. What went well this week?

I believe both myself and my partner gained a good learning experience together trying to navigate this project as a team. Everything ended up working out and we conquered this project!

3. What would you do differently?

I would attempt to spend more time making sure we are both on the same page before jumping into the code... I believe we genuinely thought we were on the same page but when we worked on our project separately at home we ended up going in totally different directions which made the merging of our code more difficult.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with a partner can be very difficult... My partner was amazing but I struggled a bit with combining our code and communicating our thoughts to each other was a challenge
