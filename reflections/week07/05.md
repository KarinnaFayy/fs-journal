# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

My partner and I ended up passing our checkpoint and were both really happy with how our site turned out!

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I was very surprised at how much I struggled with the partner project. I had an amazing partner but I need to work on my confidence with code and communicating my thoughts with logic. 

- What are you struggling with?

Working with a partner. Because I am still at a point in my learning process that I need to reference a lot of my past projects and lectures to piece together my code. So I get very nervous coding in front of my peers. This is something I will need to work on.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would most definitely count the checkpoint as a victory!! My partner and I both did an amazing job pushing through our struggles and coming together as a team in the end to make everything work out.
