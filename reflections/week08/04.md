## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

   Unit Testing: test individual units of code in isolation
    Component Testing: give users the ability to test mounted components
    End-To-End (E2E) Testing: testing for what happens when users actually use your applications

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

  End-to-End: if you're not testing what the application looks like when the user uses it, then you may have an unhappy client.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

  Barely, Component testing is the least useful but is still useful when writing code and needing to test it. It just helps with checking reactivities work with user interfaces.
