## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a column will be all the same type of information, like an address for example. In a row, you'll have different information for a specific object, like for a house.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  name STRING NOT NULL,
  age STRING,
  description STRING NOT NULL,
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Delete will leave the table behind, drop completely eliminates the table itself.
