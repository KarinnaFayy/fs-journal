## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is a unique piece of information that allows data to be organized or tracked whereas a foreign key references a piece of information found on another table, such as who created the data. Therefore, a foreign key may or may not be unique but the primary key always is.

2. What is an `Alias`?

It's a way of storing information in a table that has a column with the same title as another table that is being joined to it. For example, two tables may have an id column but the values are unique. One id column would need a different name in order to identify which column is which.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

SELECT 
p.*,
d.*,
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON d.patientId = p.id
WHERE p.id = @id;
