## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course may be one of the most challenging things I've ever accomplished. I came into the course with 0 experience and struggled to keep up and understand. I had to drop out by week 4. I knew I didn't want to give, up so I spent two weeks studying as much as I possibly could and came back to try again. I have learned so much about self discipline and focusing on success. I have gone through a rollercoaster of emotions while I run into walls of self doubt but the entire CodeWorks staff was always there for me and so supportive during this process.

I still have worry because I often need to utilize my references in order to complete the challenges of the checkpoints but I need to realize that I have learned so much since week 1. I've made it this far. I am extremely nervous for this final but I am going to utilize all of the time I have to complete this project. I am not giving up on myself and will time box appropriately. Try not to get stuck on a problem for too long and remember to take breaks.
